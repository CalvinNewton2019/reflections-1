When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You might want to do this if you are working from different computers/areas. As long as it is on a remote repository you can access it if there is internet access.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? You might want to do this manually because you might not want to include a change from the repository on github. e.g. when someone/author updates the github repository with code you dont want included.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forking is like copying a repository while it is on github. cloning is copying a repository onto your local machine. branches are different changes to your repository that you want to view as separate.
